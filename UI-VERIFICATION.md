# Shared UI verification

## Change

Keep vault layout and security flows product-owned; remove active-navigation border width changes. Shared assets are pinned to ky-ui 0.2.0 with content hashes. Product layouts, saved theme keys and named presets remain local.

## Capture conditions

Captured 2026-09-25 from this branch, using the application UI (not a design mockup). Real React UI served by Vite, with browser-only read fixtures for /api/auth/me and /api/vault/metadata. The vault is locked; API writes are refused by the fixture.

OS-following Busnes Light and Dark were captured at 1280×900 and 390×844 CSS pixels. Browser device scaling may make PNG dimensions larger. Document width stayed within the viewport in these captured states; local navigation/table scrolling is intentional. Screenshots show the selected-page accent, not a complete accessibility audit.

Live KyIdentity SSO and vault unlock were NOT exercised. The backend correctly refused startup without a configured HTTPS identity provider; authentication was not weakened.

## Checks

83 frontend tests and production build passed. Central ky-ui sync --check verified all ten consumers. Screenshot coverage is Busnes Light/Dark; existing named choices are retained, but not every named palette/page combination was visually exercised.

## Reproduce

Run npm ci, npm test (where configured), and npm run build in frontend/, then start the product with isolated local preview data following its README. Use System theme, emulate OS light/dark, and inspect both viewport sizes. Do not point preview instances at production data. For KyVault, use a configured development KyIdentity or explicitly labeled read-only browser fixtures; never bypass backend authentication.
